# Dog-Breed-Classifier

**Overview**

The aim of the project is to identify a breed of dog if a photo is given as input. If the photo contains a human face (or alien face), then the application will return the breed of dog that most resembles this person.

In this project I have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! A pipeline is built to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.


**Objective**

Building a model to classify between 133 different breeds of dogs and identify them

**The Road Ahead**

I break the notebook into separate steps to make the steps clear. The following is the steps that I followed during the project building time.

1. Import Datasets
2. Detect Humans
3. Detect Dogs
4. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
5. Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
6. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
7. Write your Algorithm
8. Test Your Algorithm
